  <td>I was hired to do this project on upwork. I later found out that the client was actually a student with this assingment. I'm only posting this on my public repo because this data source is in the public domain.
  The project is a classification problems. It involves using machine learning algorithms to classify the mushrooms are edible or poisonous that got mixed up in containers during shipmetn</td>

  <td>This involves four machine learning algorithms which will result in performance metrics of the model.
    Classification algorithms based on supervised learning which is a type of machine learning can make diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases easy. 
    Algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest are used to classify people who have a heart disease from people who do not.</td>
